
*** immediately upon entering a custom level game, I get a null reference exception
  the level seems to initialize and draw 1 frame first, though.

*** ai carriers appear to spawn endlessly for some reason.
  also the spawn-in particles never seem to disappear.
	not sure if these are related, really one bug, or two separate bugs.
	in any case it causes a major slow-down

* meta_variable_cache no longer works for inventory items.
  will need a new way to put the inventory item counts into the menu items.
	maybe a secondary draw call for each one, since draw.bmx has access to the player profile and the menu.
	and, it's already drawing some extra stuff, like the item art.
	
* in the inventory menu, ...
  scrollbar cannot be dragged if selected item is at the bottom of the dynamic list.
	works fine for items near the end.
	--- use the debugger to draw the "hit" area and see if it is the expected size?
