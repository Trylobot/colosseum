* when playing a custom level I spawn in at (0,0)

* the AI menu game sand texture is not initializing properly for some reason
  I see it as a big white/grey texture for some reason
  only reproducible at work for some reason

* the retained background particles are acquiring a very dark black outline
  over time; each call to add_graffiti causes them to get darker. not sure why
	only reproducible on nicole's netbook
