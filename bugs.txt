** performance
   the graffiti system is only marginally faster than a lock for large levels
	 so, only do it as often as possible instead of every frame
	 say once every 750 particles?

* [OLD BUG]
	when dragging the window, my physics timescale gets completely fucked.
  this causes all units to "drift"
	into walls, each other, etc. Big problems when dragging the window.
	It must be possible to detect when the window doesn't have control, and somehow prevent this
