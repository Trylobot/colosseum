* the AI menu game sand texture is not initializing properly for some reason
  I see it as a big white/grey texture for some reason

* [OLD BUG]
	when dragging the window, my physics timescale gets completely fucked.
  this causes all units to "drift"
	into walls, each other, etc. Big problems when dragging the window.
	It must be possible to detect when the window doesn't have control, and somehow prevent this
