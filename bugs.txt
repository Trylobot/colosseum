* the update() function prematurely ends the game in victory
  most likely because of the spawn_controller refactoring
	as well as the changes to update_flags()

* the AI menu game sand texture is not initializing properly for some reason
  I see it as a big white/grey texture for some reason
	only reproducible at work for some reason
