[COLOSSEUM - TO DO LIST] (O = work in progress, X = done)
	_ put explosion, smoke, spark and damage scar emitters into projectiles.
			when the projectile hits something, emit everything ("dump its load").
	_ sound emitters
	X emitters should have a particle_archetype_index range (min/max) so that they can emit many different particles
	_ explosions can also have short-lived "spark" emitters, and sparks have such trails as mentioned above
	X velocity range for projectile emitters -- ties in to weapon accuracy
	X angular velocity for particles
	X angular velocity range for particle emitters
	_ motivator class for animating "treads" and handling debris and trail emitters, attached to complex agents
	X remove dynamic fields (usually physics-related) from CREATE functions (changed them to "Archetype_.." functions)
	X class archetype libraries
	_ put class archetype initialization into XML files
	X create projectile emitter type
	X weapon accuracy values, implemented with angle variance in the projectile emitter
	X attach various emitters to turret class to be called logically on fire()
	X turret recoil
	X emitter's parent can be a particle (or projectile)
			applications: missiles!
	X alpha values for particles, birth & death
	X tread emitter and manager list
	X damage for player and enemies
	X encapsulate turret logic and make a class for it
	_ create xml format for levels
	_ create a level editor
	_ implement a physics engine, using Chris Hecker's PDF's as an example
			linear forces, center of mass, rotational physics, etc.
			application: obviously, to make the game world seem more "real"
	_ create gibs for enemies
	_ make gibs spawn as particles when enemies die
	_ create scars
	X create "shells" to be ejected from the ejector port of turret object
	_ create blocks for static environments that can be collided with
	_ create example arenas
	_ create a rudimentary AI
	X create a few enemies with guns
	_ create visible damage which "sticks" to agents
	X separate main components into files
