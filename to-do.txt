bugs________________________________________
	* collisions are buggy
		- Agent/Agent collisions don't seem to take mass into account (enough)
		- Agent/Door collisions produce a "grabbing" effect that is very distracting

	* the AI menu game sand texture is not initializing properly for some reason
		I see it as a big white/grey texture for some reason
		only reproducible at work for some reason

	* the retained background particles are acquiring a very dark black outline
		over time; each call to add_graffiti causes them to get darker. not sure why
		only reproducible on nicole's netbook

flesh out__________________________________
	net.bmx
	hud.bmx
	vehicle_editor.bmx
	- extend to be able to edit or create any unit at all and also edit sounds
	lighting and shadows (dynamic)
	- draw lightmaps on top of agents, using custom assets for each one
	- draw shadows underneath agents, manipulate the chassis graphic somehow.
	spawn_controller.bmx
	- waves

enhance____________________________________
	treads
	- have tread marks that stretch and shit so it doesn't matter how fast they're goin
	spawning system
	- want to have wave-based spawning without timers
	  that way, enemy group 2 will start to spawn after the last enemy group 1 guy dies.
	json.bmx
	- make json data aware of enumerated constants
	  whenever a "TJSONNumber" is requested, but there is instead a "TJSONString" found in the data,
		see if the string is a recognized constant
		if it is found, return its value (instead of throwing an error)
		
create_____________________________________
	prop.bmx
	material.bmx
	sound_trigger.bmx

fun stuff__________________________________
	intro animatic
	- have a little dude or a couple of em travel into the screen, and then
	  destroy some stuff, or each other, or something. something with explosions.
		and then have the logo be there underneath it all or something.
		but keep it short (and skip-able).
